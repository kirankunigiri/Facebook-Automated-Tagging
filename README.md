## Installation
Grab the .jar app from the [releases](https://github.com/kirankunigiri/Facebook-Automated-Tagging/releases) page.

## Usage
Add your group with the following format to the table.

`person1, person2, personN: signature`

**people** - Separated by commas. It is recommended to use last initial or full name if you have multiple friends with the same first name, or your internet connection is slow.

**signature** - optional. Include a colon at the end if you want to add one.

**To trigger an auto-tag, use the corresponding number key**. For example, the first group uses the number 1, the second uses 2, etc. This will probably be updated to include a double click to trigger feature in the future.


## Examples

**Format:** `person1, person2, personN: signature`

`Eugene Hasso , Lupe Comier, Kenton Daversa`

`Gabriel Absten, Cheryl Salemi, Roger Sanderson: This is interesting, check it out.`

`Sahil R, Amogh S: LOL HAHA this is hilarious`
